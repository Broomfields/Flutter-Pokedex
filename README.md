# PokeGuesser

A recreation of a web app that I made for a college assignment (inspired by *"Who's that Pokemon?"*).
This project is to help me learn Flutter and Dart.


## App Views

Here is what the Home view looks like. Apart from disabling landscape mode this part is pretty much complete.
![Home]("./documentation/Main Screen.png")

Here is the PokeGuesser view. This still needs the button actions to reveal the pokemon, and maybe add a count of discovered pokemon somehwere.
![PokeGuesser]("./documentation/PokeGuesser.png" = 250x)

Here is the Pokedex view. This could probably have a placeholder image (*maybe a silhouette or a question mark*), and maybe add a count of discovered pokemon somehwere.
![Pokedex]("./documentation/Pokedex.png" = 250x)


## App View Inspiration

The scene from the Pokemon Show that the whole app is based from.
![Whos that Pokemon]("./documentation/Whos That Pokemon.png" = 250x)

The original web application that I had made a few years ago for a college assignment, which inspired this.
![College Application]('./documentation/College Web Application.png' = 250x)
